ONE IS NOT A PRIME! IT IS UNIT.
The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

A prime is:
						# greater or equal 2, and
						# all of {2,3,...,n-1} dividing n has remainder !=0

none of 2, 3, ..., n-1
divides n without remainder

All prime numbers larger than 5 end in 1, 3, 7, or 9.

A number n > 1 is prime if it cannot be written as product of two
integers a and b, both of which are larger than 1: n = a * b

If p is a prime number and p divides a product ab of integers, 
then p divides a or p divides b. This proposition is known as 
Euclid's lemma.[3] It is used in some proofs of the uniqueness 
of prime factorizations.

relationship of the number to its corresponding value of Euler's
totient function or the sum of divisors function.
